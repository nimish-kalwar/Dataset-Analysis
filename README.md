## Conclusion
We find out which anime/show is most popular or which is highly rated and in some cases if anime is highly rated it doesn't mean it is popular among viewers.

## Reference
Dataset or csv file which we used is from Kaggle(<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marlesson/myanimelist-dataset-animes-profiles-reviews">anime.csv</a>).
