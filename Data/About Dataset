animes.csv contains list of anime, with title, title synonyms, genre, duration, rank, populatiry, score, airing date, episodes and many other important data about individual anime providing sufficient information about trends in time about important aspects of anime. Rank is in float format in csv, but it contains only integer value. This is due to NaN values and their representation in pandas.
